 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This simple project is a machine learning-based app that predicts the likelihood of a person having **diabetes** based on input health parameters. It is built using 
Python, trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, and run in Google Colab.

  Features:

- Predicts diabetes based on 8 health indicators
- Uses **Logistic Regression** for binary classification
- Accepts custom input from the user
- Trained and tested on real-world data
- Built in **Google Colab**, beginner-friendly

  How It Works:

1. Loads and cleans the dataset
2. Splits the data into training and test sets
3. Trains a logistic regression model
4. Takes user input for prediction
5. Predicts whether the user is likely to have diabetes

 Tools Used:

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
